Package: pginstall
Section: database
Architecture: all
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, make, git
Description: The PostgreSQL Extension Installer
 This package implements a PostgreSQL Extension Installer server and build
 farm management console. It needs to be installed on the central server and
 the buildfarm clients where the extension build happens.

 It's possible to then publish extension binary archives as static files
 over HTTP, and to host them on Amazon S3, so you're forced into using the
 dynamic application for serving the static files.
