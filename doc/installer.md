# The PostgreSQL Extension Installer

The installer is the PostgreSQL command hook part, that needs to be
installed on each PostgreSQL installation where you want the `CREATE
EXTENSION` to be diverted in order to use your repository server.

See the [README](/readme) for more information about how to use the
PostgreSQL Extension Installer client.
